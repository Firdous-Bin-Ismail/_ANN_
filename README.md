This project explores the Iris dataset by comparing a simple Perceptron model with a multi-layer Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The purpose is to demonstrate how a deeper network, utilizing modern optimizers and activation functions, can enhance classification accuracy.

Two approaches were tested:

1. A Perceptron, which achieved an accuracy of around 86%.

2. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with two hidden layers. The first hidden layer had 16 neurons with ReLU activation, the second had 8 neurons with ReLU activation, and the output layer had 3 neurons with softmax activation.

The network was trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.

Results ->

Perceptron Accuracy: approximately 86%

ANN Accuracy: approximately 93%
